Simula is a 3D window manager for Linux that runs on top of [[https://godotengine.org/][Godot]].

*Mission:* Facilitate a Linux future for VR & AR Desktop. In the short-run, this means allowing people to run 2D Linux apps with current generation headsets. In the long-run, this means allowing people to run Linux in standalone AR & VR HMDs. Currently, Simula is only compatible with the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pro.

*Origins:* Simula is a reimplementation fork of [[https://github.com/evil0sheep/motorcar][motorcar]]. To read about motorcar, see /[[https://github.com/evil0sheep/MastersThesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true][Toward General Purpose 3D User Interfaces: Extending Windowing Systems to Three Dimensions]]/

* Installation

[[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][file:./doc/GitterBadge.png]]

Simula is in alpha phase, and can be difficult to get working on many setups. For help with installation, please visit our [[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][chat room]]. Note that Simula has only been tested on Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco Dingo), but the instructions below should in principle work on (i) older versions of Ubuntu and/or other distros that use ~apt~ (i.e., Debian) or (ii) Arch Linux (or distros that use ~pacman~).

1. *Clone the repo and run the helper commands.* Depending upon your distro, you'll need to run some combination of ~make ubuntu~, ~make arch~, ~make nvidia~ and ~make amd~.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula
  cd Simula

  make ubuntu    # Installs needed packages via apt-get
  # make arch    # Installs needed packages via pacman
  #+END_SRC

2. *Compile Simula.* Warning: this can take a while.

  #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
  make all
  #+END_SRC

3. *Launch Simula.* You must first launch SteamVR before you can run Simula.

  #+begin_src shell
  steam &        # First launch SteamVR from steam
  make run       # ..then launch Simula
  #+end_src

4. *Launch some apps.* Once Simula starts, launch some Wayland apps to interact with.  Simula apps must be launched with ~WAYLAND_DISPLAY~ set to ~simula-0~.

  #+begin_src shell
  WAYLAND_DISPLAY=simula-0 sakura   # Wayland-based terminal
  WAYLAND_DISPLAY=simula-0 epiphany # Wayland-based web browser
  #+end_src

* Troubleshooting

Any errors can be immediately helped with in [[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][Simula's chatroom]]. Here are some helpers though:

1. *Driver errors.* If you get driver related errors, try running ~make nvidia~ or ~make amd~ to try to upgrade to the latest drivers for your respective video card. These helpers only work on Ubuntu/Arch:

  #+begin_src shell
  make nvidia # If needed: installs nvidia-driver-418 (via apt-get)
  make amd    # If needed: installs mesa-vulkan-drivers and other packages for SteamVR on AMD (via apt-get)
  #+end_src

2. *Godot errors.* If you get godot related errors, trying rebuilding ~godot~ from scratch:

  #+begin_src shell
  make godot
  #+end_src

3. *Wlroots errors.* If you get wrloots related errors (i.e., any error that complains about missing ~wlr_*~ references), try rebuilding wlroots from scratch:

  #+begin_src
  make wlroots   # If you have trouble launching Simula, try recompiling Godot via this command.
  #+end_src

4. *Unable to launch a particular app.* Many Linux apps don't work right now in Simula (technically: any app that doesn't implement the XDG Wayland protocol). We're working on fixing this ASAP so that all Linux apps are compatible with Simula. This should be done by end of month (June 2019).

* Contributing

We're looking for open-source contributors. If you're interested in using Haskell to bring VR and Linux together, drop by our [[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][chat room]], or email georgewsinger@gmail.com.
