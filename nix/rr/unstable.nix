# This is a temporary copy of the default.nix in this folder, with the version updated to the current tip of rr's master branch.
# This exists because rr has not had a release in a long time, but there have been a lot of improvements including UX.
# Some of the UX improvements help prevent foot shooting.
# Upstream has stated that it should be fine to use master.
# This file, and its attribute in all-packages, can be removed once rr makes a release.
# For further information, please see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/99535 "Improve support for the rr debugger in nixos containers"
