Simula is a 3D window manager for Linux that runs on top of [[https://godotengine.org/][Godot]].

# *Video:* [[https://d.tube/#!/v/sudoreboot/t026ny0m][See here.]]

*Mission:* Facilitate a Linux future for VR & AR Desktop. In the short-run, this means allowing people to run 2D Linux apps with current generation headsets. In the long-run, this means allowing people to run Linux in standalone AR & VR HMDs. Currently, Simula is only compatible with the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pro.

*Origins:* Simula is a reimplementation fork of [[https://github.com/evil0sheep/motorcar][motorcar]]. To read about motorcar, see /[[https://github.com/evil0sheep/MastersThesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true][Toward General Purpose 3D User Interfaces: Extending Windowing Systems to Three Dimensions]]/

* Installation

[[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][file:./doc/GitterBadge.png]]

Simula is in alpha phase, and can be difficult to get working on many setups. For help with installation, please visit our [[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][chat room]]. Note that Simula has only been tested on Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco Dingo), but the instructions below should in principle work on (i) older versions of Ubuntu and/or other distros that use ~apt~ (i.e., Debian) or (ii) Arch Linux (or distros that use ~pacman~).

1. *Clone the repo and run the helper commands.* Depending upon your distro, you'll need to run some combination of ~make ubuntu~, ~make arch~, ~make nvidia~ and ~make amd~.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula
  cd Simula

  make ubuntu    # Installs needed packages via apt-get
  # make arch    # Installs needed packages via pacman

  # make nvidia # If needed: installs nvidia-driver-418 (via apt-get)
  # make amd    # If needed: installs mesa-vulkan-drivers and other packages for SteamVR on AMD (via apt-get)
  #+END_SRC

2. *Compile Simula.* Warning: this can take a while.

  #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
  make all
  #+END_SRC

3. *Launch Simula.* You must first launch SteamVR before you can run Simula.

  #+begin_src shell
  steam &  # First launch SteamVR from steam
  make run # ..then launch Simula
  
  # make godot # If you have trouble launching Simula, try recompiling Godot via this command.
  #+end_src

4. *Launch some apps.* Once Simula starts, launch some Wayland apps to interact with.  Simula apps must be launched with ~WAYLAND_DISPLAY~ set to ~simula-0~.

  #+begin_src shell
  WAYLAND_DISPLAY=simula-0 sakura   # Wayland terminal
  WAYLAND_DISPLAY=simula-0 epiphany # Wayland web browser

  # In a few days, you'll be able to launch normal X apps as follows (you have to guide X apps to Simula's DISPLAY).
  # DISPLAY=:1 firefox
  # DISPLAY=:1 google-chrome-stable
  # DISPLAY=:1 emacs
  # DISPLAY=:1 gvim
  #+end_src

* Contributing

We're looking for open-source contributors. If you're interested in using Haskell to bring VR and Linux together, drop by our [[https://gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula][chat room]], or email georgewsinger@gmail.com.
